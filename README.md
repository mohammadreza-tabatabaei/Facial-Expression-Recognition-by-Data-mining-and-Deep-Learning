# Dataset:
I used the JAFFE dataset consists of 213 images of different facial expressions from 10 different Japanese female subjects. Each subject was asked to do 7 facial expressions (6 basic facial expressions and neutral) and the images were annotated with average semantic ratings on each facial expression by 60 annotators.

# Feature Exraction Phase:
I used data mining technique for extracting useful insights from excel JAFFE dataset which is large dataset.

# Recognition Phase:
This phase focuses on recognizing facial expression. The recognition phase makes use of CNN algorithm.
